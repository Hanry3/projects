# Rust Project

This project is developed using the **Rust** programming language, focusing on performance, reliability, and memory safety. Rust’s unique ownership model ensures efficient memory management, making it a great choice for system-level and high-performance applications.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This Rust project demonstrates the following key concepts:
- Memory safety without needing a garbage collector.
- Concurrent programming using Rust’s safe concurrency model.
- Performance optimization with zero-cost abstractions.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Concurrency**: Implements multi-threading for improved performance.
- **Error Handling**: Uses Rust’s powerful error handling through `Result` and `Option` enums.
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Rust's ownership and borrowing features ensure that memory is managed efficiently without runtime overhead.

## 📚 Technologies Used
- **Rust**: The main language used for developing this project.
- **Cargo**: Rust’s package manager and build system for compiling, testing, and running the project.
