Explanation:
Struct Definition:

The Task struct holds the description of a task and whether it is completed.
The mark_complete method allows marking a task as complete.
Menu:

The display_menu function shows the options (add task, view tasks, mark task complete, and exit).
The program runs in an infinite loop (loop {}) until the user selects the "Exit" option.
Task Management:

Option 1: Adds a task by taking user input for the description.
Option 2: Displays the list of tasks and their completion status.
Option 3: Allows the user to mark a task as complete by entering its number.
Option 4: Exits the program.
