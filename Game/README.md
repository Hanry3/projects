# JavaScript Game Projects

This repository contains two classic games implemented using JavaScript:

1. **Snake Game JS**: A fun and interactive snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow in size.
2. **Sort the Bubble Clock!**: A challenging sorting puzzle game where the player must sort numbers by rotating and swapping them on a clock interface.

# Snake Game in JavaScript

### Overview
A simple Snake game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to control the snake's movement using arrow keys, collecting food to grow the snake while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself.

### Game Mechanics
- The snake moves in a 20x20 grid.
- The player uses the arrow keys to control the snakeâ€™s direction.
- When the snake eats food, it grows in length and the score increases.
- The game ends when the snake collides with its own body.
- The game keeps track of the highest score.
